<summary>The files I use are flat JSON. How can I make this command work ?</summary>

Simply set option `keySeparator` to `false` in your `settings.json` or `settings.js`, such as :
```json title="settings.json"
{
  "keySeparator": false
}
```

<summary>I only want some types of changes reported in the result file. How can I achieve that ?</summary>

Simply set the `operations` option in your `settings.json` or `settings.js` to your liking :

:::tip

Current operations are :

| Operation | Description                                                   |
|-----------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| PUT       | When key exists in both file1 & file2 but value was replaced  |
| ADD       | When key exists in file2 but not in file1                     |
| DEL       | When key exists in file1 but not in file2                     |

:::

```json title="settings.json"
{
  "operations": ["PUT"]
}
```
